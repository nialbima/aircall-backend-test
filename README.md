# [Aircall.io](https://aircall.io) - Backend technical test

## Summary (from main repo)

The purpose of the test is to reproduce one Aircall feature: __call forwarding__.

Here is the story:

Your company has one main number. This number is an [IVR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_voice_response):
- If the caller presses `1`, call is forwarded to another phone number;
- If the caller presses `2`, he is able to leave a voicemail.

It's 9AM in the office and first calls are coming in!

## Notes + Deploy stuff!

- I got a phone number from Twilio to use for the "main office number". It's (978) 705-6710.
